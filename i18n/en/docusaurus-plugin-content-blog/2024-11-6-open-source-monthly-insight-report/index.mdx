> The OpenRank indicator is an open source implementation of the evaluation indicators in the "Information Technology Open Source Governance" series of standards of the Electronic Standards Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. It can effectively reflect the collaborative influence of open source projects among developers, thereby helping us understand the open source world, discover open source trends, and gain insight into open source events.

# This Month's OpenRank Growth Hotspot Insights

## Hot Event 1: Linux Removes Russian Maintainers, Huawei Releases Native HarmonyOS

- Data Facts: According to OpenDigger data, OpenHarmony has rapidly grown since its open-source release in August 2019, becoming the top-ranked open-source community in China. Currently, OpenHarmony projects are primarily hosted on the Gitee platform, with over 2,000 repositories, more than 8,000 contributors, and over 15,000 active developers. More than 70 tech companies, including Ruyi Software, Softpower Technology, Shencanhong, and Jolian Technology, are involved in its development.

- Detailed Analysis: In late October 2024, Linux removed over a dozen Russian developers from its kernel maintainer list due to "compliance requirements." Linus Torvalds responded firmly to other developers' questions in a subsequent mailing list. This event drew significant attention in the open-source community, highlighting the increasing impact of geopolitics on open-source technology. In May 2019, Huawei was added to the US Entity List, preventing it from using Google's Android OS. In response, Huawei released HarmonyOS in August 2019 and open-sourced its core code as the OpenHarmony project, donating it to the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation in May 2020. After over five years of development, OpenHarmony has become the highest-ranked open-source project group in China. In late October 2024, Huawei released a fully independent, natively developed HarmonyOS based on OpenHarmony's development, marking the project's maturity.

- Author's Comments: While technology itself is borderless, technologists have nationalities. In the face of significant geopolitical changes, we must maintain an open and cooperative stance while being prepared to lead and develop our core technologies. Only then can we leverage technology to drive national development and ensure strong global competitiveness.

## Hot Event 2: Open Source Summer Programs Conclude, Global Summer Activities Thrive

- Data Facts: According to OpenDigger data, due to the impact of the National Day holiday in China, most projects experienced a decline in OpenRank during October. However, due to the popularity of OSPP and GSoC, related projects saw an overall increase of 3.5%, with thousands of participants involved in summer activities.

- Detailed Analysis: Both OSPP (Open Source Promotion Plan) and GSoC (Google Summer of Code) concluded in October. According to official data, both programs set new records in 2024, with 561 and 1,133 projects, respectively. OpenDigger data shows that similar summer programs targeting college students are emerging globally. For instance, the GSSoC24 (GirlScript Summer of Code) program launched in India in October, with over 2,000 students registering for certificates. Additionally, Woowa Brothers in South Korea initiated programming training courses targeting students, with over 4,500 learning PRs and 28,000 PR review comments across 10 learning repositories in October, placing multiple repositories on the global OpenLeaderboard.

- Author's Comments: In recent years, open-source summer programs for college students have become more numerous and diverse. These programs not only produce excellent software but also provide students with valuable coding and practical experience, becoming important platforms for their technical growth and innovation.
